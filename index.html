        <p>
           Although we didn't know it, our paths first crossed in 3rd grade when we both attended the same Summer Discovery Camp at Greenfield Village.
           It wasn't until our freshman year at Divine Child High School that we met in German class and traveled on the same class trip to Europe.
           And it wasn't until our senior year of college that we actually started dating. We're not sure why it took us so long, but we're
           incredibly happy to be here and celebrate our big day with all of you.

           Having an up north wedding wasn't something that we decided out of the blue. While neither of us spent a lot of time up north when we were younger,
           we have definitely made up for it by using our family's condo in Manistee as a relaxing weekend getaway.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           A few of the reasons we love traveling up north:
           <br/>
           Hiking Nordhouse Dunes with our Wiggle Butt Casper.
           <br/>
           Swimming in Lake Michigan with Casper.
           <br/>
           Skiing/Snowbarding at multiple resorts, including Caberfae.
           <br/>
           Snowmobiling the Benzie Manistee Trails.
           <br/>
           Golfing at Arcadia Bluffs.
           <br/>
           Kayaking the Manistee Rivers.
           <br/>
           Drinking Northern Michigan craft beer.
           <br/>
           Winning money at Little River Casino.
           <br/>
          </p>
          <p>
              Our honeymoon will take us to an all inclusive resort on the beautiful island nation of St. Lucia.
